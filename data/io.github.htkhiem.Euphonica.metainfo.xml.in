    <p>
      Euphonica is an MPD client with integrated spectrum visualiser, metadata downloading &amp; more.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Responsive GTK4 LibAdwaita UI for most MPD features, from basic things like playback controls, queue reordering and ReplayGain to things like output control, crossfade and MixRamp configuration</li>
      <li>Integrated MPRIS client with background running supported (via the XDG Background protocol).</li>
      <li>Built-in, customisable spectrum visualiser, reading from MPD FIFO or system PipeWire.</li>
      <li>Rate albums (requires MPD 0.24+)</li>
      <li>Live bitrate readout + audio quality indicators (lossy, lossless, hi-res, DSD) for individual songs as well as albums &amp; detailed format printout</li>
      <li>Browse your library by album, artist and folders with multiselection support. Browsing by genre and other criteria are planned.</li>
      <li>Playlist browser and editor</li>
      <li>Sort albums by name, AlbumArtist or release date (provided you have the tags)</li>
      <li>Asynchronous search for large collections</li>
      <li>Configurable multi-artist tag syntax, works with anything you throw at it. In other words, your artist tags can be pretty messy and Euphonica will still be able to correctly split them into individual artists.</li>
      <li>Performant album art fetching &amp; display (cached with Stretto)</li>
      <li>Super-fast, **multithreaded**, **statically-cached** background blur powered by libblur's stack blur implementation</li>
      <li>Automatically fetch album arts &amp; artist avatars from external sources (currently supports Last.fm and MusicBrainz)</li>
      <li>Album wikis &amp; artist bios are supported too</li>
      <li>All externally-acquired metadata are cached locally &amp; persisted on disk to avoid needless API calls</li>
      <li>Volume knob with dBFS readout support ('cuz why not?)</li>
      <li>User-friendly configuration UI &amp; GSettings backend</li>
      <li>MPD passwords are securely stored in your user's login keyring</li>
      <li>Commands are bundled into lists for efficient MPD-side processing where possible.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>PipeWire permissions</em></p>
    <p>Euphonica requires PipeWire capture permissions for its PipeWire visualizer backend, but currently it is only possible to specify a "blanket" PipeWire permission that also allows screen recording, microphone access, etc. Euphonica does not make use of these extra permissions, and will be updated to use a more restricted "audio portal" when one becomes available.</p>

    <p>Album arts contained in the screenshots have been substituted with random photos from Pexel. All credits go to the original authors.</p>
    <p>Euphonica is solely a music player programme and does not provide any media content or sources. Users must provide their own content or manually configure Euphonica to access third party online services.</p>

  <releases>
    <release version="0.92.0-alpha" date="2025-06-14">
      <url type="details">https://github.com/htkhiem/euphonica/releases/tag/v0.92.0-alpha</url>
      <description>
        <p>New: Background mode. Euphonica can now run in the background, allowing it to serve as your MPRIS daemon. Visualisation backends and album art blur thread will be shut down upon entering background mode, reducing CPU usage to pretty much zero. Polling will still be performed to support shell applets with seekbars (GNOME does with an extension).</p>
        <p>New: Command-line argument to start Euphonica minimised (--minimized). This allows setting up autostart scripts.</p>
        <p>Fix: Playback controls are now properly centered instead of being forced to the right by long titles (which will scroll like a marquee instead).</p>
        <p>Fix: Album info and artist bio spinners not going away in case no metadata could be found.</p>

        <p>New: Cache size report and open button in Library preferences tab.</p>
        <p>Fix: Bottom bar playback control buttons not centering themselves vertically when seekbar is hidden.</p>

      <url type="details">https://github.com/htkhiem/euphonica/releases/tag/v0.90.3-alpha</url>
      <description>
        <p>From this version onwards we are targeting a v1.0 release, hence the version bump.</p>
        <p>This version introduces support for matching app accent colour to currently-playing song's album art, and a big revamp of the offline cache mechanism.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>New: album rating system using myMPD-compatible tag schema (requires MPD 0.24+).</li>
          <li>New: Optional capabilities UI with instructions on how to enable them for your MPD instance.</li>
          <li>New: UI with album-art-matching accent colour support, wider seekbar, and live bitrate readout.</li>
          <li>New: Setting custom images as album arts and artist avatars are now supported.</li>
          <li>Refactor: Replaced PoloDB with plain ol' SQLite - easier to inspect, composite indices are supported, etc. Actual metadata docs are still BSON blobs, but since they're only BSON when stored, BSON is now much less prevalent in our cache code. Also, I took this chance to significantly cut down on string clones.</li>
          <li>Refactor: Replaced murmur2 hashing of URIs with simple base64url encoding. This also does what we need (avoiding special chars) but never collides and is completely reversible.</li>
          <li>Refactor: Added loading spinners to artist bio, artist discography/songs subviews, album wiki and album content.</li>
          <li>Fix: Fixed spectrum equaliser "lifting off" from the window's bottom edge when smooth curves drawing (default) is enabled.</li>
        </ul>
      </description>
    </release>
    <release version="0.12.0-alpha" date="2025-02-16">
      <url type="details">https://github.com/htkhiem/euphonica/releases/tag/v0.12.0-alpha</url>
      <description>
        <p>PipeWire visualiser backend, fully adaptive UI and initial Flatpak release.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>New: Visualiser can now read from the current PipeWire audio stream (only way to visualisation inside Flatpak)</li>
          <li>Refactor: UI rearrangements at smaller window sizes down to 360x640 for smartphone compatibility</li>
          <li>Refactor: Visualiser backend has been refactored to allow hot-switching between data sources.</li>
          <li>Fix: Slowdowns/stuttering upon startup or large changes to the queue.</li>
          <li>Fix: Long wait times in content views after cold startup in extreme cases. We now have a second high-priority background task queue for user-initiated background tasks.</li>
          <li>Fix: Multiple download attempts sent to MPD for the same album art.</li>
        </ul>
